## Keywords

Section 3, AAC, Mobile App, Bluetooth

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design an AAC keyboard that will make suggestions to the user based on the area they are located. To the users, this is ultimatly to encourage the users to interact with one another and explore a mutual interest between each other. 

## Project Abstract

This document proposes a novel application of a text message (SMS or Email) read-out and hands-free call interacted between an Android Smartphone and an infotainment platform (headunit) in a car environment. When a phone receives an SMS or Email, the text message is transferred from the phone to the headunit through a Bluetooth connection. On the headunit, user can control which and when the received SMS or E-mail to be read out through the in-vehicle audio system. The user may press one button on the headunit to activate the hands-free feature to call back the SMS sender.

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

Similar products include [TouchChat](https://www.assistiveware.com/products/proloquo4text) and [Proloquo4Text](https://touchchatapp.com/). These are both closed-source products that aim to build a profile for AAC users so they can be more efficient. Co-location socially aware builds a profile which encourages people to interact with other AAC users by suggesting shared interests. TouchChat allows users to create profiles, save settings, and vocabulary, allowing them to switch users quickly. Proloquo4Text also saves profiles, but it saves stored phrases, conversation blocks and does predictions. Co-location socially aware is like these products in that it creates a profile, but this profile saves the users' interests. However, this app also incorporates the unique aspect of Bluetooth low energy beacons letting two users connect, giving them speech suggestions based on their common interests. Co-location socially aware will only be like the other apps in the sense that they have profiles. 

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design an AAC keyboard that will make suggestions to the user based on other users within where they are located. To the users, the goal is to encourage social interactions and explore a mutual interests. To reach this goal, the app tracks the locations of each user to recommend communication options based.

## Project Abstract

This project introduces the use of Bluetooth (BLE) beacons to facilitate fluid social connections between users with accessibility issues. These users include young children and those with non-verbal disabilities, meaning a goal of the project is to seamlessly and intuitively suggest helpful words for these use-cases. 

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

Similar products include [TouchChat](https://www.assistiveware.com/products/proloquo4text) and [Proloquo4Text](https://touchchatapp.com/). These are both closed-source products that aim to build a profile for AAC users so they can be more efficient. Co-location socially aware builds a profile which encourages people to interact with other AAC users by suggesting shared interests. TouchChat allows users to create profiles, save settings, and vocabulary, allowing them to switch users quickly. Proloquo4Text also saves profiles, but it saves stored phrases, conversation blocks and does predictions. Co-location socially aware is like these products in that it creates a profile, but this profile saves the users' interests. However, this app also incorporates the unique aspect of Bluetooth low energy beacons letting two users connect, giving them speech suggestions based on their common interests. Co-location socially aware will only be like the other apps in the sense that they have profiles. 

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.

# System Overview

## Project Abstract
This project features a couple different hardware devices that will be used for various different features. These devices are as follows:
1) An AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) device is a tool that helps individuals with communicaton challenges express themselves and communicate to others. AAC devices often take the apperance of a grid-like display in on a tablet device. The usere inputs the words/sentences they wish to express, and the device projects this input outloud. AAC device users constist of individuals whom may be affected by autism, cerebal palsy, affects of strokes, Down syndrome, ALS, or brain injuries. Our project will mainly focus on AAC users affected by autism and Down syndrome. Additionally, our clients will generally be rather young children.
2) A BLE (Bluetooth Low Enegery Device) device is a power efficient, short-range wireless gadget. These devices oftenly connect with smartphones and other devices using periodic data transfers.

This project proposes an AAC grid web app that uses BLE beacons to gain location information about a user. Using this location information, the AAC keyboard will connect the user to other users in the area. With this, AAC device will suggest interests of the users around your location. This will in turn encourage users to socialize, engage in new interests, and possibly facilitate activities that is interesting to other users and themself.

# System Block Diagram

**Diagram**
![Diagram showing AAC board interacting with backend and frontend to recommend AAC icons](../../static/img/system-block-diagram.png)

Depicts the central user:
1) Interacting with AAC device
2) Served frontend of our app
3) Device prompted for connection to BLE beacon
4) Backend uses data gathered from beacons to recommend AAC icons to frontend

These 4 components are the central actors that are able to influence and support AAC users to interact with others around them. **AS OF RIGHT NOW, BACKEND FRAMEWORK HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED UPON**.

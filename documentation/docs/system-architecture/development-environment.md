# Development Environment 

**Software** 

This project uses Expo, which is a full-stack REACT Native framework. A local development environment will be set up for running the project on Android and iOS. 

To start the development server, run 
- npx expo start

Scan the QR code in your terminal to open the emulator/simulator.  

**Hardware** 

Bluetooth Low Energy Bbeacons are used for this project. BLE interactions will be done using a REACT Native library, and functionality must be tested on a device, not a simulator.

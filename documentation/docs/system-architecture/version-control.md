# Version Control

Our team uses Git hosted on GitHub for version control. Each feature or bug fix is implemented in its own branch, then merged into the `develop` branch for integration and finally into `main` for production. The `main` branch serves as our authoritative, production-ready state of the codebase. All merges into `main` require pull requests and code review to maintain stability. Commits are kept small and descriptive to allow traceability. This workflow ensures parallel development by multiple team members while keeping the product stable.
